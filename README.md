# ChatGPT-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Prediction

## INTRODUCTION
Social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with each other, with
millions of people sharing their thoughts and opinions on various topics. As a result, sentiment
analysis, the process of identifying and categorizing the emotional tone of a piece of text, has
become increasingly important. Sentiment analysis can be used to analyze social media data to
identify patterns and trends, understand customer opinions and preferences, and even predict
future behavior.
In this project, we aim to perform multi-class sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets about
ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. The
Train dataset contains about 50000 tweets taken from Kaggle- an open data repository. The test
dataset contains 7000 tweets scrapped from Twitter using the Python library snscrape.
To perform sentiment analysis, we first preprocess the text data by cleaning and normalizing it.
This involves removing punctuation, stop words, and other noise from the text, as well as
converting the text to lowercase and tokenizing it. We then use machine learning algorithms such
as Naïve Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression, to train the model
to classify the tweets into one of the three sentiment categories.The performance of our model is
evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics
help us to determine our model’s efficiency and identify areas for improvement.
The results of this project can be used to gain insights into the sentiment of Twitter users towards
ChatGPT and other AI bots and to improve the quality of interactions with users on social media
platforms.
Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of sentiment analysis in understanding and
analyzing social media data related to AI bots and highlights the growing importance of AI and
machine learning in this field. As social media continues to grow and evolve, sentiment analysis
will become increasingly valuable in providing businesses and organizations with the insights
they need to make informed decisions and improve their products and services.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Creating a ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis and prediction model that correctly categorizes
tweet sentiment and predicts the sentiment of upcoming tweets. The aim is to analyze a large
dataset of tweets and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral categories using the
state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques provided by ChatGPT. Based on the study
of previous tweet data, the model should also be able to predict the emotion of future tweets in
real time. The final model should be highly accurate in categorizing and predicting the sentiment
of tweets related to ChatGPT.

## AIM AND OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this project is to develop an accurate sentiment analysis and prediction model
that can effectively analyze large volumes of tweets related to ChatGPT and classify them into
positive, negative, or neutral categories. The model should be able to accurately identify the
sentiment of tweets, even in cases of sarcasm, irony, and colloquialisms, and be able to predict
the sentiment of new tweets in real time. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a
powerful tool for businesses and individuals to understand the global opinion on the impact of
the OpenAI tool 'ChatGPT.'
The objectives of this study are:
* Scrapping tweets related to the OpenAI tool “ChatGPT” from Twitter using the Python library snscrape.
* To perform a sentiment analysis on the most recent tweets with the hashtag ChatGPT.
* To build a model that can predict the sentiments of ChatGPT tweets.
